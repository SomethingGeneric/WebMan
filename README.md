# WebMan
A web interface for the Arch Linux package manager (pacman)

This app based on Flask (Python) allows you to manage your Arch Linux packages in a graphical way. You can browse packages just like on the official Arch Linux website, with an upgraded UI and an install/unintall button next to them.

The app is installable via the AUR package [`webman-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/webman-git/).

*This app is still in development, so not all things may work properly yet.*
